Code for passion project of making a list of all perfect words
This is a passion project I made on 02/28/2024, about making a list of all perfect words.
I conside a perfect word to be a word that you could remove any number of letters from the end of the word and wind up with another valid word, for instance "Antsy" could be "antsy', "ants", "ant", "an", or "a"
I consider all individual letters to be a word; in scrabble, when you play your first word, you have an n letter long word horizontally (or vertically) and n one-letter long words vertically (or horizontally).
Speaking of scrabble, the list of words I used came from a 2019 document of scrabble words, included in this project. I have no idea how legitimate this list is, but it worked well enough! Unfortunately, it had a lot of weird words - state abbreviations, some French words, etc.
Feel free to use this code for anything! Play with it, change definitions, only generate a list for one letter, etc. 

Also in this folder is the initial list, and then a list of a and i words, as "a" and "I" are  the only inarguable one-letter words in the English language.
